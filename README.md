# Tank Exporter

## A tool to export Tanks from World of Tanks.
#### This is an ongoing project by me.. Coffee_

### Version 15:
Fixed a issue while writing Turret models.
Added a model info window.
Added / Fixed Visual viewer window.
Now TE seaches in the res_mods folder for a matching tank component. If it finds it, will load it from there.
Minor Bug fixes.

### Version 14:
Added Primitive Write capability.
Now you can write primitive files the game can load!
This only works will the hull or turret models.
Read the help file for more information.

### Version 13:
Added Mouse over picking of the vertex under the mouse.
This only works if UVs are visable in the Texture Viewer.
Also.. Pressing the "C" key will center the current UV in the Texture Viewer's window.
The purpose is to make it easy to locate where the UVs are mapped to.
Updated Help HTML and added a new page and image.

### Version 12:
Added Texture Viewing and UV ploting.. also a way to save the texture as a png. This is dependent on the view settings.
Added importing of the BSP2 and the tree from the tank models.

### Version 11:
Added FBX importing. Re did the User Interface. 

### Verions 10:
Now when exporting a tank in FBX, a folder is created under the tanks name in the same directory and all the textures are placed there.
