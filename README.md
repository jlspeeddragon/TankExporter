# TankExporter

## A tool to export Tanks from World of Tanks


### Version 13:
Added Mouse over picking of the vertex under the mouse.
This only works if UVs are visable in the Texture Viewer.
Also.. Pressing the "C" key will center the current UV in the Texture Viewer's window.
The purpose is to make it easy to locate where the UVs are mapped to.
Updated Help file

### Version 12:
Added Texture Viewing and UV ploting.. also a way to save the texture as a png. This is dependent on the view settings.
Added importing of the BSP2 and the tree from the tank models.

### Version 11:
Added FBX importing. Re did the User Interface. 

### Verions 10:
Now when exporting a tank in FBX, a folder is created under the tanks name in the same directory and all the textures are placed there.
