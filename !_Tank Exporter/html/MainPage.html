              <tr>
                <td height="69" background="imgs/transparent_fill.png"><p>The first time Tank Exporter is ran, It will need to gather lots of data.<br>
                  It will read and convert the shared_content and shared_content_sandbox and their HD counter parts and save only data related to the tanks in a file called shared_content_build.pkg in your temp folder section. The folder is called wot_temp.<br>
                  This process takes a LOT of time.. Be patient.. It makes accessing the data easier for the app and faster.<br>
                  <br>
When Tank Exporter runs for the first time, it will also need to download data from the <a href="https://developers.wargaming.net/reference/all/wot/account/list/?application_id=demo&language=en&r_realm=eu">WoT Dev API site.</a><br>
There is a lot of data there about the tanks such as their in game name which TE needs to function correctly.<br>
The loading of data from the API is stored in a temp folder so this only needs to happen once after you install TE.<br>
Under the File menu, you can delete the temp folder. Use this when new tanks have been added or existing ones changed. TE will shut down because it can not function with out the data. When you run the app again, it will go through all the loading of the data again. Don't reset the data unless you really need the new or changed tanks! </p>
                  <p>Tank Exporter will need the path to the game set.. It will ask for this after its done gathering data.<br>
                    Usually its something like &quot;C:\Games\World_of_Tanks&quot;</p>
                  <p>Also.. you should set the path to the res_mods folder. Its located under the File menu.<br>
                    NOTE that the version may be different from what's shown here:<br>
                    Usually the res_mods folder looks like this: &quot;C:\Games\World_of_Tanks\res_mods\0.9.20.0&quot;<br>
                    By setting the res_mods folder, TE will look for textures in that path and load them. Nice for custom skin mods.<br>
                    Also.. if you extract data, this is where it will be placed.. More on this below. You can change this path and extract the tank data anywhere you would like. <br>

                  Exporting them is done in the same way.<br>
Also.. To make life easier, you can also extract and create the data in the World of Tanks res_mods folder or where ever you chose. YOU WILL NEED TO SET THIS PATH!!!! </td>

                  Below that you can pick what to extract. Chassis, Hull, Turret and Gun.<br>
                  This also affects what textures will be extracted. If only Chassis is checked, than only textures with &quot;Chassis&quot; in their name will be extracted from the .pkg files. <br>
                  <span class="style5">Extracting to the res_mods folder will NOT overwrite existing files!</span> This is to protect any modding to textures or tank models you have done.<br>
If you want to re-extract them, delete them first.<br>
<span class="style6">NOTE:</span> Some mod installers will completely erase the contents on the res_mods folder!! 
Be sure to backup your files before using mod installers such as <a href="http://aslain.com/index.php?/topic/13-0920-aslains-xvm-mod-modpack-installer-wpicture-sound-preview/">Ashlian's Mod Installer. </a></span></td>

Clicking on a tank name adds it to the export list.. clicking on it again removes it. There is also a Menu item above the list to clear the selected tanks.<br>
Under the File Menu, there is a selection to show the folder where all the tanks are exported to. This is not much use to the average user of TE.<br>
If you are a programmer and want to use the exported tank data for Terra, there are 4 header strings in the files that explains what's in the file and the order.<br>
